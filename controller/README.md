# mdai controller

FastAPI-based supervisor that coordinates ToF triggers, RealSense capture, and the websocket bridge for the Jetson kiosk.

## Features (scaffold)

- `/healthz` liveness endpoint and `/preview` MJPEG feed for the kiosk iframe
- Local WebSocket (`/ws/ui`) broadcasting session phase updates to the React frontend
- Session manager that mints bridge tokens, manages the hardware websocket lifecycle, and orchestrates liveness capture + uploads
- ToF polling abstraction with debounce and pluggable distance provider
- RealSense service wrapper with an embedded MediaPipe liveness implementation (`controller/app/sensors/realsense.py`)

## Running locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r controller/requirements.txt
uvicorn controller.app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

Populate the root `.env` with bridge settings:

```
BACKEND_API_URL=https://mdai.mercle.ai
BACKEND_WS_URL=wss://mdai.mercle.ai/ws
HARDWARE_API_KEY=HARDWARE-DEV-KEY
```

(Existing `VITE_` entries remain for the React build.)

### Enabling the VL53L0X ToF sensor

1. Build the native reader once on the Jetson:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p controller/tof/build
   cmake -S controller/tof -B controller/tof/build
   cmake --build controller/tof/build --target tof-reader
   sudo cp controller/tof/build/tof-reader /usr/local/bin/
   ```

2. Point the controller at the binary and bus wiring via `.env`:

   ```
   TOF_READER_BINARY=/usr/local/bin/tof-reader
   TOF_I2C_BUS=/dev/i2c-1
   TOF_I2C_ADDRESS=0x29
   # Optional: expose XSHUT GPIO if you wired it
   # TOF_XSHUT_PATH=/sys/class/gpio/gpio216/value
   # TOF_OUTPUT_HZ=20
   ```

   With these values set the FastAPI service will spawn the process reader
   at startup and emit real ToF transitions instead of the mocked provider.

## Next integration steps

1. Tune the ToF thresholds/noise filtering now that hardware measurements are available through `TOF_*` settings.
2. Enable hardware capture in `RealSenseService` by ensuring the Jetson has the `pyrealsense2`, `mediapipe`, and `opencv-python` builds installed.
3. Flesh out bridge message handling (additional app â†” hardware events) once the mobile contract is final.
4. Add automated tests for session transitions (happy path, cancellation, error handling) using `asyncio` fakes.
