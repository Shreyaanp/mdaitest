# Production Testing Guide

## Quick Verification

### 1. Start the System
```bash
cd /home/ichiro/Desktop/mercleapp/mDai/mdaitest/controller
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

**Expected logs:**
```
[INFO] Starting session manager
[INFO] ToF reader starting on /dev/i2c-1 @ 20Hz
[INFO] ToF sensor active (threshold=450mm, debounce=200ms)
[INFO] Session manager started in IDLE state (camera inactive)
[INFO] Application started successfully
```

**If you see this, PROCEED ✅**

**If you see errors:**
- `FileNotFoundError: ToF reader binary` → Build tof-reader binary
- `RuntimeError: ToF reader binary path not configured` → Add to .env
- Other errors → Check logs and fix configuration

---

## 2. Test Normal Flow

### Trigger Session
```bash
# Simulate ToF trigger manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/debug/trigger
```

**Expected phases:**
```
idle → pairing_request → qr_display → waiting_activation
(wait for timeout or manual app-ready)
→ error → idle
```

### Simulate Mobile Connection
```bash
# After QR displayed, simulate mobile app connection
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/debug/app-ready \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"platform_id": "test123"}'
```

**Expected phases:**
```
waiting_activation → human_detect → stabilizing → uploading → waiting_ack
(wait for timeout)
→ error → idle
```

**Check logs:**
```
[INFO] Camera activated for biometric capture
[INFO] RealSense hardware request acquired: session (count=1, total=1)
[INFO] Frame collection complete: X total, Y passed liveness
[INFO] Camera deactivated after session
[INFO] Phase → idle
```

---

## 3. Test Error Scenarios

### Test 1: Network Failure During Token Request
```bash
# Block network to backend
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d mdai.mercle.ai -j DROP

# Trigger session
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/debug/trigger

# Expected:
# [ERROR] bridge.issue_token: network error - ...
# [ERROR] Failed to get pairing token
# [INFO] Phase → error
# [INFO] Phase → idle
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ App doesn't crash
- ✅ Returns to IDLE after 5s
- ✅ Ready for next session

```bash
# Restore network
sudo iptables -D OUTPUT -d mdai.mercle.ai -j DROP
```

### Test 2: Camera Disconnect During Capture
```bash
# Start session and get to stabilizing phase
# Then unplug RealSense camera

# Expected:
# [ERROR] Failed to collect frame: ...
# [INFO] Phase → error
# [INFO] Camera deactivated after session
# [INFO] Phase → idle
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ App doesn't crash
- ✅ Returns to IDLE
- ✅ Camera properly released

### Test 3: ToF Sensor Failure
```bash
# Kill ToF process
pkill tof-reader

# Expected:
# [ERROR] ToF reader crashed (exit code 143)
# Process should auto-restart

# Verify process restarted:
ps aux | grep tof-reader
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ Process auto-restarts
- ✅ App continues running
- ✅ Next ToF trigger works

### Test 4: WebSocket Disconnect
```bash
# Start session, then close browser tab during QR display

# Expected:
# [WARNING] WebSocket send failed: ...
# Session continues (browser tab closed doesn't affect backend)
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ No crash
- ✅ Session continues
- ✅ Clean log messages

### Test 5: Disk Full (Frame Save Failure)
```bash
# Simulate disk full (optional - may break system)
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/fillup.dat bs=1M count=10000

# Trigger session and watch logs
# Expected:
# [ERROR] Failed to save debug frame: ...
# Session continues, upload still works
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ Session doesn't fail
- ✅ Upload still works
- ✅ Only debug frames fail

---

## 4. Stress Testing

### Test 6: Rapid Sessions
```bash
# Trigger 10 sessions rapidly
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/debug/trigger
  sleep 2
done
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ All sessions queue properly
- ✅ "Session already in progress" messages
- ✅ No crashes
- ✅ Memory stable

### Test 7: Long Running Stability
```bash
# Run for 1 hour
# Let it sit in IDLE, occasionally trigger sessions

# Monitor:
htop  # Check memory usage (should be stable)
tail -f logs/controller-runtime.log
```

**Check for:**
- ❌ No memory leaks
- ❌ No error spam
- ❌ No resource exhaustion
- ✅ Stable CPU/memory

---

## 5. Frontend Testing

### Test 8: UI Robustness
```bash
# Start UI
cd mdai-ui
npm run dev
```

**Manual checks:**
- [ ] IDLE screen has NO "Mock ToF" button ✅
- [ ] Control panel has NO "ToF Trigger" button ✅
- [ ] Only "Trigger Session" button visible ✅
- [ ] Metrics update during stabilizing ✅
- [ ] Logs show all phases ✅
- [ ] Preview shows during human_detect/stabilizing ✅

### Test 9: Browser Disconnect/Reconnect
```bash
# 1. Open UI
# 2. Close tab
# 3. Reopen tab
# 4. Check connection status
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ Reconnects automatically
- ✅ Shows current phase
- ✅ No errors in console

---

## 6. Hardware Testing

### Test 10: RealSense Connection
```bash
# Check RealSense is detected
rs-enumerate-devices

# Expected:
# Intel RealSense D435I
# Serial Number: 215322072881
```

### Test 11: ToF Sensor
```bash
# Test ToF reader directly
./controller/tof/build/tof-reader --bus /dev/i2c-1 --addr 0x29

# Expected output (live readings):
{"distance_mm": 450}
{"distance_mm": 445}
{"distance_mm": 442}
...
```

### Test 12: I2C Permissions
```bash
# Verify access without sudo
ls -l /dev/i2c-1

# Should show:
crw-rw---- 1 root i2c 89, 1 ...

# Verify user in group
groups | grep i2c

# If not, add:
sudo usermod -a -G i2c $USER
# Logout and login
```

---

## 7. Performance Validation

### Test 13: Frame Capture Speed
```bash
# Monitor frame collection time
tail -f logs/controller-runtime.log | grep "Frame collection complete"

# Expected:
Frame collection complete: 15 total, 8 passed liveness, best_score=0.750

# Verify:
# - 10-20 frames collected
# - > 20% pass liveness
# - Best score > 0.5
```

### Test 14: CPU Usage
```bash
# Monitor during capture
top -p $(pgrep -f "uvicorn app.main")

# Expected:
# IDLE: 5-10% CPU
# During capture: 60-80% CPU
# After capture: back to 5-10%
```

### Test 15: Memory Leaks
```bash
# Check memory before
free -h

# Run 10 sessions
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/debug/trigger
  sleep 30  # Wait for completion
done

# Check memory after
free -h

# Verify: Memory usage stable (no gradual increase)
```

```

**Expected flow:**
1. ToF triggers (< 450mm)
2. QR code displays
3. Scan with mobile app
4. Mobile connects
5. "Center your face" instruction
6. Preview shows (with pixelation)
7. "Hold steady" instruction
8. Frame captured & uploaded
9. "Completed" message
10. Returns to IDLE

**Verify at each step:**
- ✅ No crashes
- ✅ Clear UI transitions
- ✅ Preview works
- ✅ Logs are clean

## 9. Error Recovery Testing

### Test 17: Recover from ERROR Phase
```bash
# 1. Trigger session
# 2. Disconnect network (force error)
# 3. Wait for ERROR phase (5s)
# 4. Reconnect network
# 5. Trigger session again
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ First session fails gracefully
- ✅ ERROR message shown
- ✅ Returns to IDLE
- ✅ Second session works normally

### Test 18: Camera Auto-Recovery
```bash
# 1. Start session
# 2. Trigger "processing block" errors by covering camera
# 3. Watch for auto-restart
# 4. Uncover camera
# 5. Verify capture works
```

**Expected:**
```
[WARNING] RealSense processing block failure (consecutive=1)
[WARNING] RealSense processing block failure (consecutive=2)
...
[WARNING] RealSense processing block failure after 5 attempts; restarting
[INFO] Connected to Intel RealSense D435I
```

ls -l controller/tof/build/tof-reader

# Check I2C device
ls -l /dev/i2c-1

# Check permissions
groups | grep i2c

# Test sensor
./controller/tof/build/tof-reader --bus /dev/i2c-1 --addr 0x29
```

### Issue: "Camera activation failed"
```bash
# Check RealSense
rs-enumerate-devices

realsense-viewer
```

### Issue: "Failed to get pairing token"
```bash
# Check backend connection
curl https://mdai.mercle.ai/healthz

# Check API key
grep HARDWARE_API_KEY .env

# Test token request
curl -X POST https://mdai.mercle.ai/auth \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"api_key\": \"YOUR_KEY\"}"
```

### Issue: "Frame capture failed"
```bash
# Check debug frames
ls -la captures/debug/*/

# If no frames:
# - Camera not working
# - Permissions issue

# If frames exist but all fail liveness:
# - Check lighting
# - Check thresholds
# - Review frame metadata
```
